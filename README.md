# AOC 2025
Advent of Code 2025 (I really hope I follow through this time). I'm using this to learn Rust, so I'll probably be going pretty slow this year.

**Day 1**. Day 1 was pretty much a standard I/O question. I figured this would pop up, so I was reading the Rust docs about [i/o](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/index.html) before the first problem opened.
